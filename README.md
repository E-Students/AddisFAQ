        standard organisation of a company / White and Black box testing
      -->In each company there are different people with different roles/jobs separated in different levels. On the top there is the CEO , the adminitrator delegate , that are the most rappresentative people : an example is Steve Jobs For Apple.In the second level there are the CEO board members , the CFOand the CTO . The CFO is the financial manager of the company , while the CTO is the technical manager.At the third level there are the HR , Director of human resources , the IT DIRECTOR ,the sysadmin boss, and the R&D director , that work on company resources and developements .At the fourth level there is the PM ,that manages the project (costs, quality , etc).Finally in the bottom there are the sysadmins and developers .
      
      --> The IT Director can also control and manage the problems (bugs) into the program (in the code).A BUG is a problem on the code. It was defined "bug" for bugs than on punched cards changed the reading of bits.The greatest problems are caused with the specifications of a software and the cost of a single bug is defined by the moment when a bug is found.
      
      -->To check if there are bugs in the code and to check how the program behave in different conditions , i need to use the software testing . The software testing is used for search and find a bug. When a bug is found you have to solve or comment it.

      -->There are two types of software testing : BLACK BOX testing , WHITE BOX testing.If i know the code i need to use the White box testing , otherwise the Black Box testing.
      
      -->In the black box testing i can't see the code , but i give input and get the results(output). An example is the use for the car : I see how it works without looking at the engine. A method to build a software in the black box way is the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)                               
	          It has pros : with easy implementation.
	          it has cons : you can falsify the results, pretending that the software works well.
      -->In the white box Testing i can see into the code, I do the test watching the code. A method to build a software in the white box way is the DDT(Data-driven testing) , to develop a software based on these tests.
	         ex. check the brake pads if they are consumed , then i don't see how the car slows. 
	    Problems: I can take a test suitable for the code : is an mistake, because I can do a 	test on an error ignoring others, and the test will be immune on that bug but 	vulnerable on others.
